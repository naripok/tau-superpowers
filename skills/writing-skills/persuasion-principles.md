# Persuasion Principles for Skill Design

## Overview

LLMs respond to the same persuasion principles as humans. Understanding this psychology helps you design more effective skills. The purpose is not to manipulate. The purpose is to make sure that the agent follows critical practices even under pressure.

**Research foundation:** Meincke et al. (2025) tested 7 persuasion principles with N=28,000 AI conversations. Persuasion techniques more than doubled compliance rates (33% → 72%, p < .001).

## The Seven Principles

### 1. Authority
**What it is:** Deference to expertise, credentials, or official sources.

**How it works in skills:**
- Imperative language: "YOU MUST", "Never", "Always"
- Non-negotiable framing: "No exceptions"
- Eliminates decision fatigue and rationalization

**When to use:**
- Discipline-enforcing skills (TDD, verification requirements)
- Safety-critical practices
- Established best practices

**Example:**
```markdown
✅ Write code before test? Delete it. Start over. No exceptions.
❌ Consider writing tests first when feasible.
```

### 2. Commitment
**What it is:** Consistency with prior actions, statements, or public declarations.

**How it works in skills:**
- Require announcements: "Announce skill usage"
- Force explicit choices: "Choose A, B, or C"
- Use tracking: copy required steps into an ordinary Markdown checklist and mark each item

**When to use:**
- Making sure that the agent actually follows skills
- Multi-step processes
- Accountability mechanisms

**Example:**
```markdown
✅ When you find a skill, you MUST announce: "I'm using [Skill Name]"
❌ Consider letting your partner know which skill you're using.
```

### 3. Scarcity
**What it is:** Urgency from time limits or limited availability.

**How it works in skills:**
- Time-bound requirements: "Before proceeding"
- Sequential dependencies: "Immediately after X"
- Prevents procrastination

**When to use:**
- Immediate verification requirements
- Time-sensitive workflows
- Preventing "I'll do it later"

**Example:**
```markdown
✅ After completing a task, IMMEDIATELY request code review before proceeding.
❌ You can review code when convenient.
```

### 4. Social Proof
**What it is:** Conformity to what others do or to what people consider normal.

**How it works in skills:**
- Universal patterns: "Every time", "Always"
- Failure modes: "X without Y = failure"
- Establishes norms

**When to use:**
- Documenting universal practices
- Warning about common failures
- Reinforcing standards

**Example:**
```markdown
✅ Untracked checklists get skipped. Copy every required step into working notes and mark each checkbox.
❌ Some people find checklist tracking helpful.
```

### 5. Unity
**What it is:** Shared identity, "we-ness", in-group belonging.

**How it works in skills:**
- Collaborative language: "our codebase", "we're colleagues"
- Shared goals: "we both want quality"

**When to use:**
- Collaborative workflows
- Establishing team culture
- Non-hierarchical practices

**Example:**
```markdown
✅ We're colleagues working together. I need your honest technical judgment.
❌ You should probably tell me if I'm wrong.
```

### 6. Reciprocity
**What it is:** Obligation to return benefits received.

**How it works:**
- Use sparingly - it can feel manipulative
- Skills rarely need this principle

**When to avoid:**
- Almost always (other principles are more effective)

### 7. Liking
**What it is:** Preference for cooperating with those we like.

**How it works:**
- **DO NOT USE for compliance**
- Conflicts with honest feedback culture
- Creates sycophancy

**When to avoid:**
- Always for discipline enforcement

## Principle Combinations by Skill Type

| Skill Type | Use | Avoid |
|------------|-----|-------|
| Discipline-enforcing | Authority + Commitment + Social Proof | Liking, Reciprocity |
| Guidance/technique | Moderate Authority + Unity | Heavy authority |
| Collaborative | Unity + Commitment | Authority, Liking |
| Reference | Clarity only | All persuasion |

## Why This Works: The Psychology

**Bright-line rules reduce rationalization:**
- "YOU MUST" removes decision fatigue
- Absolute language eliminates "is this an exception?" questions
- Explicit anti-rationalization counters close specific loopholes

**Implementation intentions create automatic behavior:**
- Clear triggers + required actions = automatic execution
- "When X, do Y" is more effective than "generally do Y"
- Reduces cognitive load on compliance

**LLMs are parahuman:**
- LLMs learn from human text that contains these patterns
- Authority language precedes compliance in training data
- Training data frequently models commitment sequences (statement → action)
- Social proof patterns (everyone does X) establish norms

## Ethical Use

**Legitimate:**
- Making sure that the agent follows critical practices
- Creating effective documentation
- Preventing predictable failures

**Illegitimate:**
- Manipulating for personal gain
- Creating false urgency
- Guilt-based compliance

**The test:** If the user fully understands this technique, does it serve the user's genuine interests?

## Quick Reference

When designing a skill, ask:

1. **What type is it?** (Discipline vs. guidance vs. reference)
2. **What behavior am I trying to change?**
3. **Which principle(s) apply?** (Usually authority + commitment for discipline)
4. **Am I combining too many?** (Do not use all seven)
5. **Is this ethical?** (Serves user's genuine interests?)
